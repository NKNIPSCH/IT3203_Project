        <h2>What is the Debt Snowball Method?</h2>
        <p>The debt snowball method, popularized by financial advisor Dave Ramsey, is a debt repayment strategy that focuses on paying off your smallest debts first, regardless of interest rates. Like a snowball rolling downhill, you build momentum as you pay off each debt, helping you stay motivated throughout your debt-free journey.</p>

        <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>List all your debts from smallest to largest balance</li>
            <li>Make minimum payments on all debts</li>
            <li>Put any extra money toward the smallest debt</li>
            <li>Once the smallest debt is paid off, add that payment to the next smallest debt's minimum payment</li>
            <li>Repeat until all debts are paid</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Example of the Snowball Method</h2>
        <p>Let's say you have the following debts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Credit Card A: $500 (minimum payment $25)</li>
            <li>Personal Loan: $2,500 (minimum payment $75)</li>
            <li>Credit Card B: $4,000 (minimum payment $100)</li>
            <li>Car Loan: $10,000 (minimum payment $200)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step-by-Step Process:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pay minimums on all debts ($400 total)</li>
            <li>Add extra money to Credit Card A payment</li>
            <li>Once Credit Card A is paid, add its $25 to Personal Loan payment ($100 total)</li>
            <li>Continue the pattern until all debts are paid</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Advantages of the Snowball Method</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Quick wins provide psychological motivation</li>
            <li>Simple to understand and implement</li>
            <li>Creates visible progress early in the process</li>
            <li>Helps build positive financial habits</li>
            <li>Works well for those motivated by small achievements</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Potential Drawbacks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>May pay more in interest compared to other methods</li>
            <li>Takes longer to address high-interest debts</li>
            <li>Might not be the most mathematically efficient approach</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Is the Snowball Method Right for You?</h2>
        <p>The snowball method might be your best choice if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You're motivated by seeing quick results</li>
            <li>You have several small debts you can pay off quickly</li>
            <li>You've struggled to stick with debt repayment plans in the past</li>
            <li>You prefer a straightforward, easy-to-follow system</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Remember that the best debt repayment strategy is one you'll stick with consistently. While the snowball method might cost more in interest than the avalanche method, the psychological benefits often outweigh the mathematical disadvantages for many people.</p>
