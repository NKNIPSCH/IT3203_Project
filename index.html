        <h2>Why Replace Google Products?</h2>
        <p>Google dominates the tech world, but their practices often come at the cost of your privacy and freedom. Here are some reasons to consider switching:</p>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Monopoly Power:</strong> Google's dominance stifles competition and innovation.</li>
            <li><strong>Ethical Issues:</strong> From censorship to questionable partnerships, Google's actions often conflict with their original "do no evil" motto.</li>
